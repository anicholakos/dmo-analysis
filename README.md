Abstract: In the United States, cities like Philadelphia, Pennsylvania or Portland, Oregon are
marketed by destination marketing organizations (DMOs) to potential visitors. DMO websites
mostly are a collection of information on attractions, accommodation, transportation and events.
Dr. Florian Zach seeks to conduct a historical analysis of the outbound and internal links of
DMO websites in order to learn which website DMOs point to and how this changes over time.
We will assist him in this analysis by analyzing data from top tourism websites from each state
in the United States, 98 in total. Dr. Zach's expected impact of this research is the ability for
tourism destination decision makers to learn past trends among DMOs' outbound links and
potentially determine the future direction of destination online marketing. From the DMO data,
we will deliver a set of matrices from which Dr. Zach can perform his own analysis in Python. Dr.
Zach expects DMO websites to point towards a set of common websites like social media sites,
Tripadvisor, Yelp, local websites, etc.
